There were a number of contests where participants each made multiple attempts.  The attempt with the highest score is the only one considered.  
Write a query to list the contestants ranked in the top 3 for each contest.  If multiple contestants have the same score in a contest, they are at the same rank.

Report event_id, rank 1 name(s), rank 2 name(s), rank 3 name(s).  Order the contests by event_id. Names that share a rank should be ordered alphabetically and 
separated by a comma.

Order the report by event_id.

SELECT 
  event_id, 
    GROUP_CONCAT(IF(ranking = 1, participant_name, NULL) ORDER BY participant_name ASC SEPARATOR ',') AS first,
      GROUP_CONCAT(IF(ranking = 2, participant_name, NULL) ORDER BY participant_name ASC SEPARATOR ',') AS second,
        GROUP_CONCAT(IF(ranking = 3, participant_name, NULL) ORDER BY participant_name ASC SEPARATOR ',') AS third
â€¦                              ) AS rankings
                              WHERE ranking <= 3
                              GROUP BY event_id
                              ORDER BY event_id ASC;
